-- Arithmetic operations
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 5: Retrieve employees with a salary increased by 12%
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary * 1.12 AS increased_salary FROM employees;

-- ðŸ§© Challenge 6: Retrieve employees with a salary decreased by 5%
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary * 0.95 AS decreased_salary FROM employees;

-- ðŸ§© Challenge 7: Retrieve employees with a salary that is 10% more than the average salary
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) * 1.10 FROM employees);

-- Logical operators
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 8: Retrieve employees who are either in the IT department or have a salary greater than 60000.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 3 OR salary > 60000;

-- ðŸ§© Challenge 9: Retrieve employees who are in the IT department and have a salary greater than 60000.

-- ðŸ§© Challenge 10: Retrieve employees who are not in the IT department and have a salary less than 50000.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE NOT department_id = 3 AND salary < 50000;

-- String Concatenation
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 11: Retrieve employees with their full name (first_name + last_name).
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM employees;

-- Sorting with ORDER BY
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 12: Retrieve all employees sorted by last name in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 13: Retrieve all employees sorted by salary in descending order.
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Multiple Sort Columns
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 14: Retrieve all employees sorted by department_id and then by last name.
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department_id, last_name; -- ASC(DEAFULT) for both columns

-- Positional Sorting(by column index)
-- ðŸ§© Challenge 15: Retrieve all employees sorted by the second column (last_name) in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY 2 ASC; -- 2 refers to the second column, which is last_name
-- Less readable than column names - use cautiously
